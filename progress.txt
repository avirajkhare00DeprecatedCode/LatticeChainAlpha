We need to create following things as of now:-

1. check index, signup and login page(user should be able to login and no other account from same email id)
index working, login working, need a signup page and design of login page

2. When user enters in Dashboard, it should show all tokens available in her account.
ask user to add missing tokens by giving erc20 tokens, it will loop through all the tokens and one option to add
missing token, see Vigilbot how they are able to track all tokens - using etherscan, they just see all the transactions.(option to add later)
Later option to remove token from tracking
TODO - Taking all token prices from coinmarketcap
    this is main net feature

3. In marketPlace, there will be many things, buying/selling tokens containing many tokens

    Now creating a basket of tokens to sell
    1. User can create basket in any network, just mention on top which network they are using
    2.
